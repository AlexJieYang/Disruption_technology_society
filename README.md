Abstract
In exploring the intersection of scholarly research with technological advancement and societal impact, our analysis delves into a vast repository of nearly 40 million research papers from the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), spanning 1950 to 2020 across 19 fields and 39,893 journals. Papers categorized with a lower disruption index, often considered transformative, demonstrate a weakened correlation with technological and societal domains. This hints at a bias against groundbreaking scientific pursuits. To unravel this trend, we introduce the concept of "disruptive citation," a nuanced metric gauging the absolute disruptive impact of papers. Notably, papers drawing higher disruptive citations exhibit a significant capacity to influence both technological advancements and societal spheres. Upon examining the heterogeneity across years and fields, we identify a bias against the disruption index predominantly in the last two decades and within STEM fields. However, the positive effects of disruptive impact remain consistent across all years and fields. These empirical findings illuminate the intricate relationship between disruptive scientific endeavors and their consequential influence on technology and society. By shedding light on these dynamics, our study seeks to enrich discussions regarding the recognition and role of groundbreaking scientific endeavors in shaping our world.
